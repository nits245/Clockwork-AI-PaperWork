# Solo Tenant Scenarios - Internal Draft v0.1a

**WARNING: This document is for internal planning only and not referenced in main framework due to significant risk factors**

## CRITICAL RISK ASSESSMENT

### Power Imbalance Concerns
**Single Authority Dynamic:**
- One facilitator with sole control over vulnerable person's accommodation
- No witnesses to interactions or potential misconduct
- Participant isolation from peer support and external perspective
- Coercive environment where accommodation depends on single person's approval

### Unacceptable Risk Factors
**Operational Vulnerabilities:**
- No peer oversight or community accountability
- Potential for abuse of authority without detection
- Participant dependency creating exploitative dynamics
- Legal liability exposure for organization

### AI Oversight Limitations
**Technology Cannot Replace Human Safeguards:**
- Cannot detect subtle manipulation or coercion
- No ability to provide immediate intervention
- False sense of security may reduce actual oversight
- Legal liability if AI fails to detect abuse

### Resource Constraint Reality
**"Imaginary Spare Properties for 48-Hour Relocation":**
- Unrealistic resource assumptions for emergency alternatives
- No viable backup accommodation options available
- Financial constraints prevent maintaining alternative sites

## RECOMMENDATION

**Avoid Solo Tenant Operations:** Single-person scenarios create unacceptable risk levels that cannot be adequately mitigated with available resources. Operations should be suspended until multi-participant environment available.

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Volunteer oversight from program alumni or community members
- Reciprocal arrangements with similar programs
- Remote supervision through regular video calls
- Community partnerships with existing support organizations
